## NOT IMPLEMENTED - Future Work Required

The following documents describe planned features that are not yet implemented:

### Section 19: Multi-room Grouping
- **Status**: VERIFIED
- **Location**: `src/group/` module
- **Description**: Multi-room audio grouping with synchronized playback
- **Dependencies**: Requires clock synchronization infrastructure

### Section 21: AirPlayClient Implementation
- **Status**: VERIFIED
- **Location**: `src/client/mod.rs`
- **Description**: Unified high-level client combining all components
- **Note**: Individual components (discovery, connection, streaming, control) ARE implemented

### Section 22: High-Level API (AirPlayPlayer)
- **Status**: VERIFIED
- **Location**: `src/player/mod.rs`
- **Description**: Simplified player API for common use cases
- **Dependencies**: Depends on AirPlayClient (Section 21)

## Previously Corrected Documents

The following documents had deficiencies that were corrected:

1. **02-core-types.md**
   - Updated AirPlayDevice struct (addresses field, raop_port, raop_capabilities)
   - Added address() and supports_raop() methods
   - Updated QueueItemId as struct with atomic counter
   - Updated QueueItem with original_position field
   - Added RaopError enum and AirPlayError variants

2. **06-rtp-protocol.md**
   - Added ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption support
   - Added RtpEncryptionMode enum
   - Updated module structure with raop submodules
   - Added encode_arbitrary_payload method
   - Added encryption error variants

3. **17-state-events.md**
   - Changed PlaybackState::Stopped to PlaybackState::default()
   - Updated mod.rs structure
   - Updated checkboxes

4. **18-volume-control.md**
   - Replaced stub send_volume() with actual implementation
   - Replaced stub get_device_volume() with actual parsing
   - Updated checkboxes

5. **20-mock-server.md**
   - Updated checkboxes
   - Noted try_parse_request() usage

6. **37-receiver-session-management.md**
   - Updated checkboxes

## Recommendations

1. **Priority 1**: Implement AirPlayClient (Section 21) to provide unified API
2. **Priority 2**: Implement AirPlayPlayer (Section 22) for simplified usage
3. **Priority 3**: Implement Multi-room (Section 19) for AirPlay 2 feature parity

The library core (protocol implementations, receiver mode, RAOP support) is complete and functional.
