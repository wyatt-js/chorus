//! Unified PTP node that participates in both master and slave roles.
//!
//! A `PtpNode` can simultaneously:
//! - Send `Sync`/`Follow_Up` and respond to `Delay_Req` (master behaviour)
//! - Process incoming `Sync`/`Follow_Up`, send `Delay_Req`, and process `Delay_Resp` (slave
//!   behaviour)
//! - Evaluate Announce messages and switch roles via a simplified BMCA
//!
//! This is needed because `AirPlay` 2 devices (e.g. `HomePod`) may act as
//! grandmaster clock, and the client must be able to sync to them. The
//! role is determined by comparing clock priorities from Announce messages.
